## Introduction

A simple program that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a strong password. It is a program that I created to train on JS skills and improve my ability to write clean code.

## Features

One of the advantages of this program is that you choose the number of letters in the password and the method of writing it in terms of whether it is lowercase, uppercase, lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. All of this is selected using the checkbox button.
